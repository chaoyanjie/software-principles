## Single Responsibility Principle

The [single responsibility principle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
is a computer programming principle that states that every module or class
should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by
the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the
class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
Robert C. Martin expresses the principle as,"A class should have only one reason
to change."


## Open窶田losed Principle

In object-oriented programming, the [open/closed principle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open窶田losed_principle)
states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open
for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can
allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.
