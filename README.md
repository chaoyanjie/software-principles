## Single Responsibility Principle

The [single responsibility principle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
is a computer programming principle that states that every module or class
should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by
the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the
class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
Robert C. Martin expresses the principle as,"A class should have only one reason
to change."


## Open窶田losed Principle

In object-oriented programming, the [open/closed principle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open窶田losed_principle)
states "software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open
for extension, but closed for modification"; that is, such an entity can
allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its source code.


## Liskov substitution principle

Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that,
in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be
replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted
with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties
of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.). More formally, the Liskov
substitution principle (LSP) is a particular definition of a subtyping relation,
called (strong) behavioral subtyping, that was initially introduced by
Barbara Liskov in a 1987 conference keynote address titled Data abstraction
and hierarchy. It is a semantic rather than merely syntactic relation, because
it intends to guarantee semantic interoperability of types in a hierarchy,
object types in particular.
