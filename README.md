## Single Responsibility Principle

The [single responsibility principle](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
is a computer programming principle that states that every module or class
should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by
the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the
class. All its services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
Robert C. Martin expresses the principle as,"A class should have only one reason
to change."
